Linux
=====

Similiar to Windows there exists a python file called hystck_example_ubuntu.py under *hystck/examples/*, execute it::

	$ hystck/examples/hystck_example_ubuntu.py

This Python-script will bring up the virtual networks, clone the ubuntu vm called ubuntu_template and start this vm. As state of now the hystck-host-part will only try to connect to the ubuntu-guest and shutdown afterwards.
