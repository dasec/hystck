This file will guide you to the documentation which will help you install hystck.

## Where do I find the documentation?
The documentation can be found in 'docs/src/'. As the folder name suggests this only contains the source 
files of the documentation. In order to get it in readable format you need to install sphinx and inside the folder
run the command ```make html```. After this you will find the newest documentation in HTML format in the subfolder
'_build/html'. Just open the index.html with the browser of your choosing.
